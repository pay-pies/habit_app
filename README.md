# <ins>Habit Tracker App</ins>
## About:
This a habit tracking app for android using React Native and Appwrite. 

## How to Use:
Clone the repository:
```
gh repo clone pay-pies/habit_app
```
Run the code:
```
npx expo start
```
I have tried downloading the project + converting to an apk file but it didn't work when I tested it and I haven't tried it again since.

Time spent: 20h 53min (Hackatime decided about 4-5 hours of it was 'ai coding' so only 17 hours 3 min counts on my Summer of Making project, I did use AI more than usual since it is my first time using React)

- Most of the code is from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50gwzwLvAk)
- I used Google Gemini and Github Copilot for troubleshooting stuff (e.g. problems with Appwrite, syntax errors)
